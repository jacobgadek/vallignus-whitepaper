# Vallignus Runtime Governance Whitepaper

This repository contains the official technical whitepaper for **Vallignus**, a runtime governance framework for autonomous AI systems.

The paper introduces an execution-layer control model designed to enforce deterministic policy constraints on autonomous agents at the moment authority is exercised.

## About Vallignus

Vallignus proposes runtime governance as a distinct control primitive for autonomous systems.

Rather than shaping model behavior through alignment or output filtering, runtime governance enforces policy directly at execution time, ensuring unsafe, excessive, or unauthorized actions cannot occur.

This approach is intended for environments where autonomy must coexist with enforceable boundaries, including enterprise infrastructure and government systems.
